            // TODO If you completed all of the triangle generation above, 
            // you can just return from the Create() method here to test what you have
            // accomplished so far. The originalTriangles
            // will be visualized as translucent yellow polys. Since they are translucent,
            // any accidental tri overlaps will be a darker shade of yellow. (Useful
            // for debugging.)
            // Also, navmeshPolygons is initially just the tris. Those are visualized 
            // as a blue outline. Note that the blue lineweight is very thin for better 
            // debugging of small polys
            

            // ********************* PHASE II - Merge Triangles *****************************
            // 
            // This phase involves merging triangles into larger convex polygons for the sake
            // of efficiency. If you like, you can temporarily skip to phase 3 and come back
            // later.
            // 
            // TODO Next up, you need to merge triangles into larger convex polygons where
            // possible. The greedy strategy you will use involves examining adjacent
            // tris and seeing if they can be merged into one new convex tri.
            // 
            // At the beginning of this process, you should make a copy of adjPolys. Continue
            // reading below to see why. You can SHALLOW copy like this: 
            // newAdjPolys = new AdjacentPolygons(adjPolys);
            // 
            // Iterate through adjPolys.Keys (type:CommonPolygonEdge) and get the value 
            // (type:CommonPolygons) for each key. This structure identifies only one polygon
            // if the edge is a boundary (.IsBarrier), but otherwise .AB and .BA references 
            // the adjacent polys. You can also get the .CommonEdge (with vertices .A and .B).
            // (The AB/BA refers to orientation of the common edge AB within each poly 
            // relative to the winding of the polygon.)
            // If you have two polygons AB and BA (NOT .IsBarrier), then use 
            // MergePolygons() to create a new polygon candidate. You need to 
            // check IsConvex() to decide if it's valid. 
            // If it is valid, then you need to remove the common edge (and merged polys)
            // from your adjPolys dictionary and also add the new, larger convex poly. 
            // And further, you need all the other common edges of the two old merged polys 
            // to be updated with the merged version.
            // You actually want to perform the dictionary operations on "newAdjPolys" that
            // you created above. This is because you never want to add/remove items
            // to a data structure that you are iterating over. A slightly more efficient
            // alternative would be to make dedicated add and delete lists and apply them
            // after enumeration is complete.
            // The removal of a common edge can be accomplished with newAdjPolys.Remove().
            // You can add the new merged polygon and update all old poly references with
            // a single method call:
            // AddPolygon(Polygon p, Polygon replacePolyA, Polygon replacePolyB)
            // Similar to the updates to newAdjPolys, you also want to remove old polys
            // and add the new poly to navMeshPolygons.
            // When your loop is finished, don't forget to set adjPolys to newAdjPolys.
            // If you don't do the last step then it won't appear that you have done any merging.

            // TODO At this point you can visualize a single pass of the merging (e.g. test your
            // code). After that, wrap it all in a loop that tries successive passes of
            // merges, tracking how many successful merges occur. Your loop should terminate
            // when no merges are successful. Given that we only make a shallow copy,
            // a single pass through will create convex polygons possibly larger than 4 sides.
            // It is possibly impossible for more than one pass to be needed, but the
            // attempt at extra passes doesn't hurt.
            // Be sure you see the blue lines disappear along edges where mergers occured.


            // *********************** PHASE 3 - Path Network from NavMesh *********************

            // The last step is to create a Path Graph from your navMesh
            // This will involve iterating over the keys of adjPolys so you can get the 
            // CommonPolygons values.
            //
            // Issues you need to address are:
            // 1.) Calculate midpoints of each portal edge to be your pathNodes
            // 2.) Implement a method for mapping Polygons each to a list of CommonPolygonEdges,
            //      and mapping CommonPolygonEdges to path node indexes (ints)
            //
            // For 1.), You can add the end points of the edges together and divide by 2.
            // 2.) is a bit more challenging. I recommend the use of Dictionaries for the mappings.
            //  You may benefit from a two-pass approach, iterating over the adjPolys.



            // ***************************** FINAL **********************************************
            // Once you have completed everything, you will probably find that the code
            // is very slow. It can be sped up a good bit by creating hashtables of common calculations.
            // This is not required though. (The biggest cause of major slowdowns
            // is print statement within inner loops. So be sure to remove.)
            //
            // Also, there are better ways to triangulate that perform better and give
            // better quality triangles (not long and skinny but closer to equilateral).
            // However, you don't need to worry about implementing this.
